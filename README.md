# Predicting Usersâ€™ Preferences for Movie Recommender System Using Restricted Boltzmann Machine and Python

Recommender system is one of the most important crucial parts for e-commerce domains, enabling them to produce correct recommendations to individual users.  In this work, a model has been developed that uses Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) to learn deeply and predict if a user is going to like (yes or no) a movie.
